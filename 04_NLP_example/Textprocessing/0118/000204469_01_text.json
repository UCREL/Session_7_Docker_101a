It is the dead of night ; all London is at rest, Save where from yonder wide, illuminated street, The hum of crowds who seek with eager step their homes, Breaks on the watcher's ear. Anon, the broken laugh Of one o'ercome with wine, jars on the silent air. In that vast room the feast is spread ; the sparkling cup Is passed from hand to hand : and 'midst their glee, the shout, \" Lony live the Queen!\" startles the neighbouring dreamers. While Low crouching cold in yon recess, the beggar clasps Her tired child, and strives to wrap her in the rags That with each effort tear afresh. That babe 's the last Of a once merry throng, whom want and foul disease Have slain. The mother weeps in grief, but not despair; She puts her trust in Him who answered Hagar's cry : Her longing eyes peer through the open window wThere The festive board speaks plenty, while she starves with- out, The laugh, the toast, the song, alternate pass, A guest Withdraws from that carouse, and, stalking homeward, meets The weeping outcast."], [10, ""], [11, ""], [12, "4 THE NIGHT OF THE CORONATION. \" What !

Soon this babe shall pray for thee \u2014 and though As yet, poor child of sorrow, nameless she hath been, I '11 call her now, Victoria ! While the onward course Of years succeeding, marks this joyous day's return, The name may nourish still in her young heart the . thought Of charity to all, and trust in Heav'n.

In yon rich chamber sits a girl, o'er whose pure brow The suns of nineteen summers have not shed a care. Upon that bed, whose silken fringes sweep the floor, Is cast a crimson robe, with gold and ermine decked ; The crown lies near it, thrown impatiently aside. Clusters of gems, and broidered badges of her state, Are scattered at her feet. Attendance irksome felt But now, she bade all leave her \u2014 she 's alone with Heav'n.

A solemn act Hath left its impress ; tender feelings, anxious thoughts, Religious hopes, are struggling there. She is not now The queen of ocean's pride, fair Britain's rocky isle ; She is the young, pure, trusting, inexperienced girl, Launched on a sea as yet by her unknown, uncrossed.

What though this day first saw a heathen envoy * come In peace to hail the crowning of a Christian King ! What though two gen'ralsf who in strife had oft, as chiefs Of adverse armies, met, now both in friendship's bonds United, cheered me there ! Ah, no ! it was not these, Though glad events they are, that filled me with deep thoughts : It wras the awful charge that I this day have ta'en Upon myself.\" So mused the maid, when rising swift, As by a sudden impulse urged, upon her knees She sunk, and with clasped hands raised her adoring eyes To Him who still is present ev'rywhere, unseen. * The Turkish Ambassador. f Wellington and Soult."], [14, ""], [15, ""], [16, "6 THE NIGHT OF THE CORONATION.
