The Province of Khandesh is an extensive fertile and well watered plain \u25a0of about thirteen thousand square miles in extent, and interspersed with ranges of low barren hills, at the base of which run nume- *A map of the pro- rous rivers and rivulets flowing from the table land into the river Taptee.* This province is nearly surrounded by broad chains of mountains whose sides are clothed in noxious vegetation, where for many months of the year, none but the hardy denizen of the hill can exist, and where secure in the unwholesome fastnesses of these more elevated regions, the Cateran could undisturbedly collect his wild force and burst from the bosora of the mist upon the unsuspecting prey on the plain. The tabular trap hills of the Saat-pooras which form the Northern boun dary of the province, are separated from each other by ravines of vast magni tude, and are covered with splendid forests which afford amidst the most romantic scenery, unbounded shelter to the outlaw. On the West the great Siiklit.ni range rises steep and stony ; these Ghauts however are not broken but sustain tangled masses of Bamboo, which is found nowhere else in greater lux uriance or more difficult of access, whilst the continuous ranges of'Chandore, Saatmulla and Ajunta, bound the province to the South, and the thick Bau ble jungle which shrouds their thousand dark dells, presents equal difficulties to the pursuit of the offender, as do the low sterile hillocks which to the East ward separate Khandesh from the rich plains of Berar. The roads also until a late period were ill appointed and deficient in every thing but discomfort and danger ; few and far between were the miserable hamlets, and the passes through the mountains were rugged and impractica- ble as their fierce possessors. The decline of this rich province from the flourishing condition which it had obtained under its Mahomedan masters, is to be dated from the year 1802, when it was ravaged by Holkar's Army. This blow was followed by a famine in 1803, and its ruin was subsequently consummated by the rapacity and misgovernment of the Peishwa's Offi- cers. The Bheels who had heretofore mixed with the other inhabitants, and had, as village Watchmen, been the great instruments of Police throughout Khandesh, being re.luced to a state of starving desperation, withdrew to the surrounding mountains. The Pindarrees meanwhile annually ravaged the open country, various insurgents plundered at the head of bodies of horse, and parties of Arabs establishing themselves in the numerous fastnesses and forts, laid all the neighbourhood under heavy contribution. The expulsion of the Arabs was a natural consequence of the war, and the bodies of plundering horsemen were unable to keep the field, but the settlement of the Bheels proved to be an undertaking of much greater difficulty."], [12, "2 From remote ages, the Bheels have been recognised as a distinct people, and in a Sanscrit Vocabulary about seven hundred years old, the term \"Bheel,' is used to denote a peculiar race of barbarians, subsisting chiefly on plunder, and found more particularly on the mountainous tract along the Nerbudda ; still earlier mention of this race is made in the celebrated Hindoo poem of the Mahabhurat, where the Bheels are minutely described, and a long and fabulous account is there given of their origin ; but although frequently no ticed in the Mahomedan histories of Malwa and Guzerat, as a powerful na tion, inhabiting the mountains and forests of Meywar and Oodipoor, having independent Chiefs and Rajahs, and holding their own Courts and Durbars, yet the most ancient records of Khandesh merely allude to the residence of the tribe in small numbers on the Northern boundary of the province, which may indeed be considered as a spur from the vast mountainous tract then possessed by the nation. The Bheels being driven by other tribes from Meywar and Joudpoor set tled amongst the rocky ranges of the Saat-poora, the Vindhya and the Saatmulla, and amidst the woody banks of the Mhye, the Nerbudda and the Taptee, where, protected by the strong nature of the country, they have since dwelt, subsisting partly on their own industry, but more generally on the plunder of the rich land- holders in their vicinity, considering depredation on the inhabitants of the plain as a sort of privilege, and a tax upon all per sons passing through the country of their occupation as a national ri^ht. The bulk of the Bheel population in Khandesh, which is estimated at one eighth of the entire inhabitants of the province, is chiefly settled in Bauglan and to the North and Northwest, where they in general reside peaceably as patels, cultivators and proprietors of the soil. In this portion of the province they are not so degraded, because they are not so completely destitute of all those claims that usually command consideration ; they are not so exposed to want nor so enured to hardships, and therefore neither so reckless of their own or the lives of others, and possessing landed property, obligations as pro prietors are imposed : the respect of others necessarily induces a certain degree of self respect, and in proportion as these essentials are present or absent the Bheels are more or less civilized and inclined to live in peace and quietness. The most restless and troublesome are those dwelling immediately at the foot and amidst the recesses of the surrounding ranges, who at different periods have either usurped or have been entrusted with all the Passes leading into the country, and till lately have held charge of many of the most important fortresses in the plains. Their hivelike habitations, formerly crested the top of each isolated bill, where approach from every side was easily defended or immediately discover ed, and these hovels not reared for permanent occupation but hastily put to gether to be crept into for a few months or weeks, were without regret aban doned on any occasion that induced the occupants to shift their quarters. Roving and restless by disposition, and skilful hunters by necessity, the woods and jungles supplied them with roots, berries and game; a successful stray filled their stores to overflowing, and as every man's hand was lifted against them, so the measure of wrath was fully returned by the tribe, whose powers of mischief far exceeded those of their numerous oppressors, and whose habits and locations enabled them to bid such a lengthy defiance to so many governments. The more civilized generally apply the term Bheel to all who lead a law less life, and who reside in a remote junjily country, but the name is given to many who do not acknowledge it, and the following are the only clans in Khandesh who deserve the appellation. The \"Turrees\" who embraced the Mahomedan faith during the reign of Aitrungzebe, and who inhabit the country to the Northeast of the province from Arrawud to Boorhanpoor ; they are a fine race of men, and abhorring"], [13, "3 the idea of leaving their immediate homes, are somewhat more inclined to agriculture than others of this roving class, but in the times of disorder they frequently accompanied the Pindarees during plundering excursions, and gained a name for licentiousness fully equal to that of their allies. \u2014 The fairer complexion and finer feature of the Turrees may be traced to the Mahome dan colonists, whom the Mogul policy had located among the hills. Immediately in the neighbourhood of the Turrees are a savage set o\u00a3 beings termed \" Nahals,\" who exist perfectly wild among the mountains, subsisting chiefly on roots, fruits and berries ; they court no intercourse with others, and dwell in the unrestrained freedom and hardship of an utter savage existence. Marriage contracts as well as all other religious ceremonies, are entirely dispensed with, and the assorted pair are free to live together whilst they choose, or separate at pleasure and convenience; the infant accompanies its mother to her next abode, but the grown up children remain with the father. The Nahals are dark and diminutive in statue, and their features are exceedingly ill favored. A few of this tribe cultivate a little grain among the ashes of the burnt boughs of the forest, or barter the produce of their jungles for cloth, but they are very seldom to be met with beyond the im mediate bounds of their unhealthy location.. Another race of Mahomedan Bheels termed\" Hirdhi,\" reside about the Ajunta range in the Pergunnas of Jamuair and Burgaon ; the intervening distanee alone prevents their intermarriage with the \"Turrees,\" for their creed and ideas are similar ; they are however of a discontented and quarrel some disposition, difficult to manage, and still more ferocious than their brethren to the Eastward, and during seasons of disturbance,, the most atro cious acts have been invariably ascribed to their prowess. The common Khandesh Bheels who are scattered in such numbers throughout the province, reject however all distinguishing name of clan o* easte, and glory in the simple appellation of \" Bheel.\" Indolent, dissipated and singularly improvident, they consider themselves the highest of their tribe, and although they condescend to receive food from the hands of those who have degraded themselves by honest labour, yet they will not intermarry with those who have thus sunk in their estimation. To barter any thing but what was reaped by the hand of violence, was an offence against the tribe ; to cultivate or engage in mechanical craft, deeply degrading ; and no em ployment was considered to be correct, which in any way interfered with the cherished burden of the long bow, and the ponderous sheaf of arrows. Local situation in some instances, and in others, the gallant bearing of a powerful chief, have bestowed the name on the few seceders from the nation. The \" Mutwarree\" the \" Burda\" and the \" Dorepie,\" inhabit the moun tainous range to the Northwest about Akrany and Dhergong, and became despised on account of their skill in- basket-weaving and cultivation. The term '\u2022 Khoteel\" is generally applied to all the wild inhabitants of the Saat-pooras, who barter gums and wax for the produce of the plains, and that of \" Daungchee\" to all the natives of the Daung, who live below the western ghauts. These latter are the most uncivilized of all the wild tribe*, with intellect barely sufficient to understand and totally unequal to compre hend any thing beyond tbe most simple communication ; and with forms stunted by the hardships, the noxious climate and the bitter poverty in which they are steeped, it cannot be a matter of surprise, that among a set of such degraded beings the principles of right and wrong. are entirely lost ; the fear of consequences overwhelmed in a blind reliance on their fortune ;. the dread of treachery, the predominant idea; and the animal instinct alone remaining in full force, to urge the supply of theip daily wants. Superstitious in the extreme, and possessing little attachment to fixed spots, their temporary villages are removed on the occurrence of any evil omen ; freely addicted to intoxication, their evil propensities burst into a"], [14, "4 flaming fire, when roused by the effects of ardent spirit ; and led in large bodies by numerous leaders, they were for years a scourge to all around. Ten thousand of the Guicowar's troops sent for the purpose of their coercion were defeated and driven with disgrace from their fastnesses, and it remained for their reformed brethren in Khandesh under their European leaders, to overrun their tangled forest, to seize all their potent leaders, and to reduce the race for the first time to a state of entire and unconditional subjection. During the struggle between the Mahomedans and the Mahrattas, the ex cesses of the Bheels arose to a great height, yet it may be said that Khan desh was in a flourishing condition up to the year 1798, when Bajee l.ao succeeded on the death of Nana Furnavese to his free exercise of authority as Peishwa, but the successful rebellion of Yeshwant Row Holkar which short ly afterwards broke out, proved to be the commencement of the manifold miseries and misfortunes of this Province, which during a period of two years was on three occasions sacked and devastated by the marauding troops ; and the scourge of war was in 1803 succeeded by a most unusual and withering famine which extended from the Saat-poora hills to the city of Hyderabad. Under this calamity the country became for a time deserted, many cultivators fled to Berar and Guzerat, the greater portion of the Bheel population aban doned the plains and returned not again, and now commenced the Bundumul, that period of utter anarchy and confusion, which so long reigned throughout this unhappy land. Organized gangs started up in every direction, and the mountain ridges were quickly studded with Hutties, from the tiny hamlet of the freebooter, to the grand encampments of the powerful naicks, who, assum ing the state of petty princes, despatched their armies of a thousand men to sack and lay waste the surrounding country. On the occupation of the Province of Khandesh by the British Govern ment in 1818, anarchy and lawless oppression had reached a fearful height, and murder and rapine stalked openly and unrestrainedly through the land. Fifty notorious leaders infested this once flourishing \"Garden of the west,\" and their every command was implicitly obeyed by upwards of five thousand ruth less followers whose sole occupation was pillage and robbery, whose delight, alone consisted in the murderous foray, and whose subsistence depended en tirely on the fruits of their unlawful spoil. Smarting also under the repeat edly broken pledges of the former Native Government, and rendered savage from the wholesale slaughter of their families and relations, the Bheels were more than usually suspicious of a new Government of foreigners, and less than ever inclined to submit to the bonds of order and restraint. From Kokurmonda to Booranpoor the whole range of the Saat-poora mountains teemed with the disaffected. The Saatmulla and Ajunta Kneels under thirty-two leaders were in arms in numerous parties, carrying fire and sword over the Southern parts of the province, and the petty Rajahs of Peint and Abhona having united with the powerful Naick, Govinda, the work of desolation was urged with a bloody hand through the entire range of the Wes tern Ghauts. The roads were impassable, villages in every direction were plundered and murders daily committed, cattle and hostages were driven oft\" from the very centre of the province, aud the excesses rose to such a height, that the Ryots refused to receive Tuccavee, whilst their property was thus utterly insecure. The first plan adopted by Colonel Briggs on the occupation of the pro vince of Khandesh by the British Government, was to stop the supplies of food which were chiefly drawn from the plains, to cut off any parties of Bheels that attempted to issue for plunder, and to make vigorous attacks on the points within the hills to which the chiefs had retired. During the second year of British Administration, many of the Chiefs by the prompt decision and the praiseworthy efforts of the British Troops, were either seized or killed in battle ; but these chiefs were in most cases succeeded"], [15, "5 by others equally powerful and ferocious with themselves, and beyond the immediate influence of the British troops, there was little protection for life and property in Khandesh. Proclamations were in vain issued that former ciitnes would be forgotten and that in future those Bheels who returned to the plains should be fed at the expense of the village ; the amnesty was un heeded and rejected and not one of the tribe repaired to take advantage of the liberal offer. No regular police existed at this time ; the Bheels who formerly had been the village watchmen were in arms against the State, and reports daily arrived of robberies, murders and house-breakings, upwards of one huudred com plaints of this nature being made during the course of one month, from the single district of Nundoorbar. An Irregular Corps of Turree Bheels was at length attempted on the principle of confirming the hereditary Naicks as the superiors of the Legion, but the experiment entirely failed, the men being constantly in a state of intoxication, and their grovelling habits proving inca pable of restraint by Native Officers who were equally licentious with them selves, this body was ultimately disbanded as totally useless. Amonst the many plans which were agitated to restore peace to the pro vince, Colonel Briggs the Political Agent, proposed to pension every ma rauding Bheel in Khandesh on a monthly allowance of two Rupees together with a certain quantity of grain ; military operations were however finally resorted to, and parties of Sebundees and regular troops were despatched to protect the Passes, but they were shortly obliged to quit, leaving two-thirds of their number victims to the malaria, and the charge of these important outlets was again handed over to the loose control of the hereditary Naicks on double their former allowance, but with no happier effects than before. During the four succeeding years the same successive arrangements were pursued with equally unsuccessful results; conciliatory measures were first adopted, settlements of the most liberal nature were entered into with many, and these entirely failing, recourse was had to arms, which only for a time, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the force, had the temporary effect of apparently subduing these untameable spirits. A new era in the history of this province was however about to commence ; the physical condition of the Bheels was to undergo a thorough and whole some reformation ; banishment, imprisonment, the lash and the gibbet were to be abolished, and the gentle hand and the persuasive word of a mild and paternal Government were to lead the hitherto wild man within the pale of civilized life, and to unfold to him the blessings of peace and good order. This is not a fitting place to comment on the conduct of the local Officers who were employed to introduce these ble.-sin_s. or otherwise much might be said in praise of all ; but credit is especially due to Colonel Archibald Ro bertson, under whose auspices this new policy commenced, whose talents were equally conspicuous with the liberality of his sentiments; and to the zeal, ability and fearless energy, which on e\\ery occasion were displayed by the Agents, Captain Outran) and Majo. Ovans, must be mainly attributed the much desired result which followed the conciliatory line of policy so ably carried out by those Officers."], [16, "6 PART IL THE CONCILIATORY POLICY WITH ITS RESULT. The Province of Khandesh under the new system was divided into three agencies, which were apportioned lo as many Officers, who were expected to reside within the limits of their respective districts. Nundoorl.ar, Sooltanpoor and Pimpulnair with all the independent and tributary chieftains, including those of the Daung, formed the North Western Agency. Jamnair, Burgaon and Chaleesgaon comprehending the districts below and adjoiningthe Ajunta and Saatmulla range fell to the share of the Southern \u2022_ and the North Eastern agency extended along the Saat-poora range including the districts of Chopra, Yawut and Sowda, to which were afterwards added the centre divisions of Errindole, Amulnair, and Nusserabad. To the Officer in charge of the last mentioned agency the duty was likewise entrust ed of raising a Bheel corps under active Native and non-Cominissioned Officers from the Line, and the following instructions which were issued may be justly considered as tbe ground work <>_ the reformation. The Agents were to preserve the peace of the country, to ameliorate the condition ot the Bheels and to retain a watchful superintendence over the range committed to their charge, and while endeavouring to inspire the wild men with confidence in the Government, to encourage their at tentions towards industrious pursuits ; to redress all complaints, and to be careful that those on whom pensions had been conferred were duly paid'. It was also the duty of the Agents to act as arbitrators, when the parties mutually agreed, to apprehend offenders, and to commit for trial, or otherwise to inflict such punishment as might be customary among the tribe; and to superintend all such military operations as might be considered necessary to reduce gangs who still continued to commit depredations. The Bheels were to be registered and called upon to render an account of the manner in which they obtained their livelihood ; waste lands were to be allotted to all who were willing to form themselves, under certain restrictions, into colonies ; they were to be restricted from congregating in masses, prevent ed from quitting, without intimation, their places of abode, and strictly checked from assembling in \" Hutties\" among the hills on any pretence whatever. Security was to be taken from those against whom strong suspicion was en tertained, rewards of free-rent land, of animals and implements of husbandry were sanctioned for meritorious conduct in aiding the Police or for remark able industry in cultivation, and the Patels of Villages were also to be en couraged by the presentation of honorary dresses to assist in promoting the desired object, by forwarding to the Agents correct returns of all the Bheels within their range, of the mode by which they subsisted, and of the adequacy or otherwise, of the provision allotted by the State for their maintenance. A general superintendence of the Bheels and the petty Chiefs was required, and the dues payable to the former in Villages were to be strictly enforced \u2022 Punchayets were in some instances allowed to inflict punishment under authority of the Agent, but imprisonment was ordered to be avoided as at tended with little inconvenience to the delinquent, but with great misery to those who depended upon him for support; besides, the Bheel considering it no disgrace whatever, returned to his home from a residence in the jail, in do ways subdued in disposition and considerably deteriorated in morals."], [17, "7 The Head Quarters of the Bheel Corps were ordered to be stationed at Dhurrungaon. The pay of the men was fixed at five Rupees a month with an additional Rupee as batta when on outpost duty, clothing was to be furnish ed by Government, and armed with fusils the levy was to be drilled as Light Infantry. At first much duty was not to be expected, but the men were to be em ployed in such a manner as would teach them obedience to orders, the very essence of future duty, and the only antidote to their loose and irregular habits. Attention was also to be paid to their personal appearance, whereby more favorable impressions would be excited in respect to themselves, and for the same reason, punishments of a personal nature were to be avoided, and dis missal from the corps for serious offences might be made with advantage, previous to the offender being handed over to the Civil power. The main features therefore in this theory of reformation were the awarding strict justice to an oppressed race, the overthrow of the patriarchal authority of the Naicks, and the substitution in their stead of a European Chief who should be equally respected and obeyed, and whose commands and precepts would prove of a very different nature to those which had heretofore emanated among the hills, the conciliatory character and talent of the officers to be employ ed, the judicious selection for the new Military body of the wild unruly spirits who disdained the toil of honest labour, and the settlement among colo \u25a0nies of the more staid among the society, the provision of a comfortable maintenance for every one, the re-establishment of the ancient Village Bheel Police, and above all the mild and liberal, though firm spirit of the existing administration which encouraged with generous assistance the well disposed, exercised a wholesome control over the evil doers, and whose measures under .he new arrangement were equally certain of being promulgated and enforced 'by unbiassed servants. Military operations were now reduced to the more feasible scale of harass ring the armed bands among the hills, and of allowing them little rest in any one locality, and a general amnesty was offered to the tribe, with the excep- tion of the most heinous offenders, for whose apprehension large rewards were proclaimed. Fatigued and worn out by the hardships of their miserable situa- tion and finding the spoil of the low country becoming daily more fruitless and inaccessible, after a lengthy negociation, a few of the principal Naicks \u25a0were with difficulty induced to take advantage of the humane offers of Go- \u2022vernment, whilst others of the desperadoes were betrayed among their imme- diate places of refuge. A free pardon was granted for all past crimes to those who surrendered at discretion, waste lands were allotted rent free for a term of twenty yeais, wherever the Naicks and their followers proposed to settle, and an ample .grant of money for clothes and subsistence, together with animals and imple ments of cultivation were allowed during the period when the rude husband man was under proper instruction to make the earth yield up her treasures -for his own support. This grant was however to be received not as a free gift, but as an advance to be hereafter recovered, should circumstances permit, and as the money was judiciously expended under the immediate superintendence of the Agent, and never intrusted to the improvident squandering of the Bheel, the advantages were sufficiently apparent, and a most powerful check was thus placed upon the present, and a strong hold was obtained over future indolence and licen tiousness. The greatest difficulties were, however, experienced in settling to peaceable pursuits these wild intractable characters, in breaking through their prejudices against labor, and in eradicating their propensities to plunder and debauchery. The rude and half savage race moreover viewed with sus-"], [18, "8 picion, the system of liberality and forbearance observed by the British Go vernment, and naturally suspected the recurrence of former treachery ; but strenuous endeavours successfully convinced them of the utter groundlessness of their fears and the folly of their former conduct, and by working on the better feelings of the race, the knowledge began to gain ground, that the Government not only possessed the means of restaining their future depreda tions, but also entertained an ardent wish to promote their benefit and wel fare. The success of these exertions shortly became manifest, and numbers of the tribe having availed themselves of the proffered terms, settled quietly in dif ferent locations ; and supplied by the Agent with food and implements of hus bandry, they gradually abandoned their scruples in regard to labour, while each succeeding day increased their confidence in the promises of Govern ment, and as the more fiery and turbulent were periodically drafted to the new corps, the little colonies were allowed to remain in peace and quietude, unagitated by the unruly designer whose word had formerly stirred up the dullest spirits to ferocious deeds. The novel and arduous undertaking of raising a corps from these predatory tribes had been already commenced, and Captain Outram, who was at the time serving with the Military detachments acting against the Bheels, seized every opportunity in his power to hold intercourse with this rude and savage people. Living unattended for weeks together amongst their \"Hutties\" by the fearless and manly confidence which he evinced in their honor and good faith by so unhesitatingly entrusting his life to their keeping, he succeeded in inspiring them with a conviction that the British Government was sincere iu its professions of hating their interests and welfare deeply at heart. Indulging the wild men with feasts and entertainments and delighting all by his matchless urbanity, Captain Outram at length contrived to draw over to the cause nine recruits, one of whom was a most notorious plunderer, and had a short time before successfully robbed the Officer Commanding the Detach ment which had been sent against him. This infant corps soon became strongly attached to the person of their new Chief aud entirely devoted to his wishes, their good wdl had been won by his kind and conciliatory manners, while their admiration and respect had been thoroughly roused and excited by his prowess and valour in the chase. By means of these nine recruits Captain Outram was enabled to attract others to his standard, and on the conclusion of the Monsoon he left the Head Quarters of Dhurrungaon at the head of sixty men, armed with bows and arrows, and marching round the province, successfully recruited in every district, A draft of forty regulars from the Line was received to act as driil masters and Officers, but the Bheels appearing suspicious of this arrangement their muskets and belts were for the time laid aside, and confidence was only regained by the assurance that all were to be alike in appearance and duties and that when properly sensible of the utility of the measure they should be all alike aimed in the European manner. The reception of these wild recruits by the 23rd Regiment Bombay Native Infantry in the Camp of Malligaum, was greatly conducive to the good cause men of the highest caste behaved in a manner most flattering to the feelinos of the mountaineers, visiting them, and presenting them with betelnut to the no small amazement of the guests and to the gratification of Government who complimented the Regiment on their conduct. While however the work progressed thus favourably, it was at the same time evident that extreme difficulties had yet to be encountered ; inveterate habits were not to be changed in a day, and in addition to the natural repugnance to restraint and subjection to law, strange rumours and reports were afloat throughout the province, regarding the intention"], [19, "9 of Government in thus forming the Bheels into a corps. They were told at one time by the evil disposed, that the object was to link them in a line like galley slaves, and then to extirpate the race, that their blood was in high demand as medicine in the country of their foreign masters, and that assemblage in the corps would be speedily followed by massacre as of yore ; numbers in consequence of these idle and mischievous rumours after having with the utmost exertions been induced to enter the ser vice, absconded in terror, and confidence was alone ultimately regained when permanent dwellings were commenced at the Head Quarters and when lapse of time evinced the groundless nature of their fears. Villages were still occasionally plundered and gangs remained in arms among the Hills, but suspicion had been thoroughly instilled among the heads and leaders of the tribe ; the summons for Black Mail was unheeded by the villagers, aud the information of private haunts and fastnesses which was now in the possession of the local authorities enabled the military forces to act among the hills with some chance of success. The system of reformation continued with unabated vigour in the Colonies, and at the close of the year 18*26 upwards of three hundred ploughs had been established. Time and patience and considerable persuasion were of course necessary to induce the Bheels to undertake agricultural pursuits, and to place the Colonies on a regular footing ; bu*. the wild material was fast accu mulating, and the hereditary watchmen were gradually returning from the hills to their villages. Increased to three hundred men, the corps was now drilling at Head Quarters, and in the commencement of the second season of their service, the first opportunity was afforded to the reformed Bheels of Khandesh of shedding their blood for their new masters ; they freely risked their lives, and although opposed by their own caste and relations, fought boldly for the Government. The village of Boorwarree had been attacked and plundered, and emissaries from the gang were passing rapidly among the hills to collect the disaffected, when a small detachment of the Bheel Corps arrived at sunset on the spot. Dashing immediately into the hills, Captain Outram arrived, after a tedious night's march, on the eminence where the gang had retired, when he was im mediately assailed by showers of arrows and stones, a Jemedar and many of the recruits were wounded, but the men fought on steadily and the enemy was eventually driven from the commanding position it had occupied. Fatigued however with the night march and the severe exertion of fol lowing the gang from hill to hill, a retreat was feigned by Captain Outram's gallant little band, and the enemy being by this ruse deluded with the idea of victory, and drawn down upon the open plain, were charged and dispersed at the point of the bayonet, the plunder of the village was recovered, arms and other property secured, the marauding chief and many of his followers killed in the action, and the gang entirely dispersed. After this demonstration, the Corps rapidly increased ; and during the rains of 1 827 six hundred rank and file were kept steadily at drill ; the huts and pendalls were completed at Dhurrungaon ; the life of comparative ease and comfort was highly relished, and, the draft from the regulars consisting only, of men of high caste and character, the association inspired the Bheels with a great degree of respect for themselves. The feelings as well as the persons of the tribe were enlisted into the ser vice, their evil passions were at first tolerated to control and lead them to the desired end, confidence was at length obtained in their suspicious minds, and admiration of their officers ensured by a display of superiority in those very qualities they most prided in themselves. Their sympathies and feelings were also studied and cultivated, their improvement in heart and spirit closely looked after, and that stability of connexion between the chief and his sol-"], [20, "10 lowers which in earlier times was little more then a chain of slavery and the permanence of evil, in its better modification, became the bond of fellow feeling and good order. At the close of the monsoon of 1827, this newly raised corps was reviewed by the Brigadier of the district, whose high commendation, after four days exercise, for dress and steady performance of intricate man\u0153uvres appeared in the General Orders of the armv. It indeed seemed extraordinary to every one, that the character of this wild and savage race could have been so readily tamed and that their manners and lives could in so short a space of time have been subjected to so decided a reform. Proceeding thus rapidly from the enlistment and marching about the country which might be considered as the first shadow of a drill, a result was accomplished through prudence, per- severance and courage, which many might have wished for, but very few anti cipated . Immediately after the review the greater part of the corps was marched offin detachments to relieve, as far as their numerical strength would admit, the unhealthy outposts on the frontiers of the province, and the troops of the line were withdrawn into Camp. By continual residence among the Colonies, by unwearied attention to their wants, wishes and peculiarities, and by kind and liberal treatment, the affec tions of the race were entirely gained, and the word of the Agent was receiv ed as law. Hespectiiii: him as a protector and benefactor as well as a just ar bitratoi and judge, every real or imaginary wrong was submitted to his decision ; to him the Bheel turned for advice and assistance whenever advice and assistance could be of any use ; greater obedience was rendered than had been ever paid to the hereditary Naick, and duties which were not faithfully and earnestly discharged, if not voluntarily performed, were rigidly enforced.

You have lived in the hills and plundered the roads and country of the Sirkar, and committed thefts and various crimes, now you are present and have peti tioned the Sirkar that, if pardoned you will not again offend, and that if Tuecavee be given to you, you will cultivate and thus earn a subsistence ; on this, your prayer has been considered and the Sirkar has shewn favor to you, and has this once pardoned your past crimes and has given you for your support Tuecavee and land to cultivate, and this Kowl is written and presented to you that you may remain in your Village and cultivate and thus gain your livelihood. After this if you again commit any otfence, your former crimes will not be considered as for given but you will have to answer both them and tlie new crime. Signature of Bheel Agent. to the terms of the amnesty, a written kowl to the effect quoted in the margin, was presented to each individual, which served as a pass of se- curity when absent from his Village, and which was ex- pected to be kept always near his person. In this doc- ument it was freely written and explained, that although pardon was granted for all past offence, yet any fu- ture infringement of the peace would involve a forfei ture of the protection, and mat the penalty tor the past as well as for present misdeeds would be ex acted from the offender. But a happy change was fast progressing in the habits and ideas of the race ; few who took the Kowl ever violated their engagements and when call ed upon to apprehend marauders or to trace the perpetrators of crime the most ready and valuable assistance was ever rendered to the Police and' the bulk of the people being thus favorably inclined to order, the refractory Naicks were forced into submission, and an arrangement for the regular nav ment of a certain sum of money was at length satisfactorily effected in lieu of their hucks which had been heretofore received in kind from every vil lage of the district. J"], [21, "11 The village Police now alone remained to be extricated from the mass of disorder, into which every measure regardiug the Bheel system had been for merly plunged, so as to allow every chance to the healthy operation of the new reform. When wielded in the hands of a powerful Government, the system of Bheel Police had been found to perform the most efficient duty, but when the curb of restraint was removed, the most glaring abuses and flagrant crimes were speedily induced ; under the name and shelter of the Jogla watch men, the Bheel plunderer remained unmolested within the precincts of the vil lage, and few of the Native functionaries could resist the easy acquisition of property by a share of thespoil which was so readily awarded for the protection. A strict enquiry was therefore absolutely necessary, when the amount of Hucks in each separate village, together with the number of persons required for the performance of its duties were correctly ascertained, the requisite quota was placed in charge, the surplus drafted to the Colonies, and the regular paynient of these dues, which when neglected, was attended with such evil, was strictly enforced by personal superintendence. The amount of rent-free land, was also fairly fixed, according to the size and revenue of the village, and for a share of the produce, this land being cul tivated by the Patel, a bond of good feeling was thus mutually established between the parties, the Bheel was left at liberty to attend to the numerous and important avocations of his office, for the due performance of which every hour was necessary, and the duties of the Patel and the Tagla being intimately connected, if the former functionary retained a proper interest in the security of the inhabitants and a vigilant watch over the conduct of the Tagla, their combined knowledge and assistance could, in all cases of crime, be rendered of the most material service. By this settlement, a sure remedy was provided for the former heavy evils, by ensuring an honest subsistence to all the Taglas who were found in the village, and who instead of being the scourges ot\" the country were now con verted into active and useful members ot Police, whilst those who took to the plough, gradually, like their brethren in the Colonies, became quiet and obe dient cultivators. After a lapse of three years, the remnant of the predatory Bheels in the Saatmulla and Ajunta range who had been so long carrying on depredations on the Eastern frontier, were brought to terms, and the system was fairly estab lished in the Southern parts of the Province. A register of all the Bheels had been framed, a Kowl was in the possession of every individual, the hucks of Naicks and Taglas had been enquired into and adjusted, the Native functionaries were required to see the dues properly paid, and the Bheels ventured not to leave their villages without permission from the Patel. A Darogha Carkoon was employed in each Talooka, constantly moving from village to village to see that orders were attended to, and that the Bheels were present and busy with their ploughs ; a Darogha Sebundee was stationed in each Colony to superintend and overlook its proceedings, and the Agent continually moved through his districts, to ensure, by his personal inspection, the effect of his orders. The result of his reticulated settlement was shortly manifested, and these districts formerly the scene of every outrage, where neither life nor property were secure, now enjoyed tranquillity ; the roads formerly hazardous for the armed party, were traversed at all hours by single passengers, the formidable list of crimes had dwindled down to the report of a few petty thefts, and the Bheels from outcasts had become members of the society, daily rising in respectability and appearance, and becoming useful and obedient servants of the State."], [22, "12 It was a matter of astonishment to behold the rapid change produced by the liberal system of Government, in a race of miserable beings, who withont a rag to cover their backs, and hardly a morsel of food to put into their mouths, had so shortly before sued for life and food from the foreigner, and were now fat and sleek and decently clad, living in their own huts, surrounded by swarms of healthy children, ploughing their own lands, and many in the honest possession of flocks and herds. The principles upon which the Bheel corps was raised, were equally simple at.d unquestionable ; to secure the enlistment of chiefs, their relations or mem bers of their clans, to enforce the progressive advancement of all, through the intermediate grades of private and non-Commissioned Officer, to regulate the reins of discipline with a delicate and judicious hand, and to observe a just and proper distribution of punishment and reward. On these sure principles the Corps soon contained within itself such a number of influential persons, connected or intimately acquainted with every Chief or tribe of importance in Khandesh, that provided a Bheel culprit re mained in the province, his name and village only being sent to the Com mandant of the corps, apprehension followed nearly to a certainty. Five years had hardly elapsed from the day when the first wild recruit was enrolled in the service, and when the sword of the mountain cateran was first exchanged for the ploughshare, but during that period the spirit of affairs had undergone a happy change, and the country enjoved repose. For years Khandeish had been subjected to utter misery and relentless spoliation from the organized gang and the tyrannical Bheel chief, but the generosity of Government, and the anxiety and exertion of its Agents were now amply repaid in the complete success of a system, which had thus restored peace and quiet. . To show the confidence that had been restored throughout the country, the recital of the following fact may not be considered unworthy of notice. In a village near the Saat-poora range a petty theft had been committed by a few boys, who carried off the cooking utensils from two houses ; the Patell and other inhabitants who suffered were asked how it happened that such articles were taken from their houses without awakening them, and the gra tifying answer was received, \"That since the Government settlement had \" been made, no one in the village ever thought of fastening up their nous \" es at night considering themselves in perfect security\". The same character existed, the evil propensities could not be as yet totally eradicated, but the wise measures in force had corrected the one and checked the other, gang robberies had ceased for a period of 12 months and there existed not in the Province one single leader of marauders. The conduct of the corps was deserving of the warmest praise, and its services were actively and continually employed in opposing on outpost a front for the purpose of checking foreign aggression, or in the pursuit of foreign marauders. When called upon, the men had invariably shown a wil lingness, and readiness to act against friend and relation, and were ever on the alert to obey the commands of their Officers, whilst the gradual intro duction of regular discipline had been applied to the root of the evil, and their wild and lawless habits had been completely corrected. The vice of intoxication had been thoroughly overcome, not even the most trifling complaint against any one member of the corps had been made to the authorities, and Government had thus obtained the services and labor of a body of men, which had so long troubled the repose of the former, as well as the present administration ; to such lengths indeed were the excesses car ried, that the Poona Government looked alone to the extermination of the Race for repose, whereas the present, by its reformation, had added a strength to the executive power which few could have anticipated."], [23, "13 During the attainment of such a desirable result, Government was subjected \u201e_, . , , , , , . _ to a considerable outlay of * The total amount in round numbers, advanced by Go- , \u2014 j , \u25a0 vernment to establish the Colonies was Rupees S5,.00, of money, and suffered loss, by this sum Rupees 44,000 have been recovered, -Ra- 17,001) the non-repayment of advan are still outstanding, of which one half may be recovered rB\u201e* m\u201er\\a tr. ,h_ T.li__l. and thus the total deficit amounts to Rupees 32,500. , . , , , , DHeeis, which have lapsed from death or other accident, but the reformation of the tribe from their savage and tur bulent habits has proved a blessing and a benefit to the country, for which no pecuniary sacrifice could be too great. The future prospects held out by the effV ct of this enlightened and gener ous policy, are also not less cheering; principles are now recognized, and agencies brought into play, which inevitably progress to future stability, the increased ease of circumstance and comfort lead to a prolongation of human life, and the effect of liberal laws, will gradually tend to melt the separate drop into the general mass. At present the land of Bheel location * is cultivated as a free gift from Government, hereafter, as education raises this race of men from the low and barbarous rank it held among our native subjects, an addition may accrue to the revenue, and an accession of sturdy cultivators, from the huts of this prolific tribe to fill up those blanks caused by the sweeping scourges which too often desolate the province, but these are secondary objects, when com pared to the one so wonderfully and successfully gained, which has secured to the country a state of quiet and repose, unknown to it for nearly half a century. The Bheel now feels a relish for that industry which renders subsistence secure, and life peaceful and comfortable, he unites with the Ryot in the cultivation of those fields, which he once ravaged and laid waste, and protects the village, the traveller and the property of Government, which were formerly the ob jects of his spoliation ; the extensive wilds which heretofore afforded him co ver during his bloody expedi ions, are now smiling with fruitful crops; and population, industry and opulence are progressing throughout the land. The reform has been steadily pursued with equal success to the present f t The close of the year 1843. day; Schools have been introduced for the benefit of the rising generation, and the present youth in ured to labour and sobered by instruction, have lost the recollection of the state of older times, when, from their insulated position, the tribe alone retorted ha tred and vengeance upon their oppressors ; the requisite number of ploughs have been long since established for the maintenance of the numerous Colonies which are scattered over the southern districts, and although, the strain be somewhat too tight for the bow, and the duties exacted be too numerous for the strength of the Bheel corps, such as indeed could not be with justice per formed by almost two Regiments of the Line, still there exist few instances of grumbling or infidelity The men have been always successfully employed and have proved equally staunch and faithful on the unhealthy outpost, and among the intricate defiles of the mountain range, daring alike the insidious fever and the arms of the enemy; they have ever proved superior to the difficulty, the fastnesses have been penetrated and cleared on every side of the province, internal and external disturbance have been through their exertions entirely quelled, and led by their Officers, they have acted with success against every marauding tribe in the vicinity of Khandesh, and have been employed with equal credit to themselves against their turbulent brethren in Guzerat.

As an item of economy the reduction of an entire locsd corps, a portion of the Auxiliary horse, and a large body of Peons, whose services were in con sequence no longer required, together with the abolition of two* heavily paid appointments, the duties of which have been added to those of its Comman dant, have more than covered the expense of the corps. One Regiment of the line has also been entirely withdrawn from the province, while the health of the remaining troops is carefully preserved, f The hitherto untameable Bheel banditti cannot now as formerly unite in general insurrection, without punishment, few individuals who offend against the laws can elude the arm of justice, and by thus wisely employing a small portion of the community a numerous race is kept in subjection, the tranquil lity of this immense province is satisfactorily obtained, which no military force nor expenditure of treasure could have otherwise effected, the physical condition of the people has improved from the cessation of trouble and the suppression of feudal enormity, and the blessings of thousands of happy and reformed beings daily rise as a grateful offering to a munificent Government who have thus shed so bright an influence over their destiny.

The pension arrangement, providing for the chiefs and a few followers, no doubt reduced the strength of the gang, fewer villages were attacked, but the number of murders, robberies and house breaking was by no means reduced. Expeditions sent against Kania Dusrut, and Koor Wus- sawa in the Saat-poora and against Chiel Naick in the Saatmullar range ; chief apprehended and hanged. The whole province a scene of utter confusion, the village Police aiding the plunderers and the devastation carried on with impunity. Raising a Bheel corps under consideration, but the Political Agent reports the Bheels as unfit for Sepoys, recommends that all Bheels in the pro- vince receive two Rupees per mensem. Both plans negatived, Sebundies and regular troops sent to garrison the Passes, but are withdrawn disabled by the climate, and Goomany and the other Naicks re-established on double allowance.

All the available force of the Bheel Corps and auxiliary Horse, together with a strong detachment of regular Troops, march on the Daung, a severe and harassing campaign ensues, owing to the excessively difficult nature of the country, the rapid movements of the Bheels, and the assis- tance universally afforded to the enemy by the Guicowar's Officers.
