Ah not without meaning did Nature place That keen little eye in that smooth sleek face, That restless, inquisitive, hungry eye, Which nothing could pass unscrutinized by ! Alone midst Hindoos, he lived like Hindoos, Dressed in turband, and cloths, and light-yellow shoes. Ruby and diamond rings gleamed on his hands : He was rich in gold, and houses, and lands : Massive chains on his person he wore, And all knew his Phaeton in Jollipore. When at evening he drove his pair of Pegus He received low salaams from all the Hindoos ; And a nod from the Sahibs, as if to say, ' That's a good sort of fellow in his small way.'"], [20, "6 THE JOLLIPORE BALL.

To each gent in the station He made a little verandah-oration. To the Collector he said, \" If Master please, I will give for this Ball one thousand rupees.\" A committee was formed of three or four Of the leading gentry of Jollipore. In their hands the Parsee entrusted all The arrangements required for the forthcoming Ball. They tasted the Champagne beforehand to see It was real Simpkin, not gooseberry. (Afterwai'ds Rummybhoy used to say Six dozens disappeared in this mild way !) They issued the ' invites.' At length the night came Which should inaugurate Rummybhoy 's fame."], [21, "the jollipore ball. 7 O what a rare sight was the \" Public Hall\" On the night of the famous Jollipore Ball ! From above colour'd lamps their lustre flung ; And around gay flags and curtains were hung. From the roof silk cloths, white, crimson, and gold, Here tastefully droop'd in some elegant fold : Whilst there some leafy device might be seen, Whence grapes in cluster fell purple and green. Each window'd recess of the Hall was a bower Of pomegranates in fruit, and pomegranates in flower. The doors were festoon'd with hollyhocks, Rose, tuberose, myrtle, verbena, and phlox. And creepers in flower, with tendrils of vine, Around the pillars were taught to twine. And now on the well-wax'd boarded floor Throng'd the fair and the elite of Jollipore : Twenty -six gentlemen, ladies eighteen, Lent a hfe and a soul to the pleasant scene. Merry music, fair forms in movement light, And lovely faces aglow with delight. There supporting the fragile Emily Moore Whiri'd Snaffle, the pride of his cavalry corps. Here Miss Flashleigh's dark-eye shot its fieriest glance. As young Spoonington span her along in the dance. Even old Judge SneerweD was heard to confess That the Parsee's Ball was a perfect success.

For never before had Rummybhoy Been so puffed up with pride, so elated with joy. Grin after grin on his features glow'd : Hither and thither he bustled and strode : Dressed in his best, with bran new things on, And the largest of all his diamond rings on. Then off he went to the Public Hall To see for himself the Jollipore Ball. But first to the Supper-Room went the Parsee, From whence, through the half-open door, he could see The ladies fleetly and faerily pass, \u2014 (What nautch-girls they'd make, thought Funnydass !) A cluster of gentlemen stood near the door, Round Rice the Collector of Jollipore : \u2014 Said Colonel McDreepweel, \" Rice, ma boy, Wha's this canny body \u2014 this What's-his-name-bhoy ?
